**Intro**
=================

Cosmic Muon Tracker (CMT) is a portable charged particle (Muon) Tracker, which is used to track and acquire live muon trajectories. Eight layers of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are used to track Muons by ionisation. Each Muon event from the tracker is processed by the FPGA based data acquisition system and generates events based on coincidence. Events are also displayed in the form of LEDs in real-time. CMT can be used to plot angular distribution of muons, counting rate of strips and their dependence on ambient parameters such as temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure, which are recorded by the DAQ (Data acquisition module).

**Muons**
----------
The muon is an elementary particle belonging to the family of leptons (2nd generation),
and one of the nature’s fundamental “building blocks of matter”. The other members of the
lepton family are the Electron and Tau. Muons were discovered by Carl D. Anderson and
Seth Neddermeyer at Caltech in 1936, while studying cosmic radiation. The existence of the
muon was confirmed in 1937 by J. C. Street and E. C. Stevenson's cloud chamber
experiment.

Muons are 1/2 spin particles, similar to electrons with electric charge of -1e but with a
much greater mass. Muons have a mass of 105.7 $\frac{MeV}{c^2}$, which is about 207 times that of
the electron. They participate in electromagnetic and weak interactions, but not in strong
interactions. Due to their mass, muons are unstable and while passing through matter can
decay into two ways via weak force, either captured by the nucleus to emit a neutron or by
spontaneous decay to produce an electron (or positron) and two neutrinos.

$$N(t) = N(0)\exp^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}$$
Where $N(0)$ is the initial population of muons, $N(t)$ is the population of muons at time $t$ and $\tau$ is the muon lifetime. The muon lifetime is measured to be **$\tau = 2.19703 \mu s$**.
