 I am currently pursuing Masters in Data Science from South East Technological University (SETU), Ireland. My interests lie in the fields of Image diffusion, NLP, neural networks, ML and big data. I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer. 
  
  I am extremely passionate about science, technology and art. My previous qualifications are BSc and MSc in Physics.
