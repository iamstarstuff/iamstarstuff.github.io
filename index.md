 I am currently working as a Technology Analyst at AIB Ireland. My interests lie in the fields of computer vision, NLP, neural networks, ML and Big Data.

I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotographer, passionate about science, technology and art.

My previous qualifications are Masters in Data Science from South East Technological University (SETU), Ireland. Prior to this I have a BSc and MSc in Physics from University of Mumbai.
